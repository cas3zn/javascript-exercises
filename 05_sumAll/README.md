# Exercise 05 - sumAll

Implement a function that takes 2 integers and returns the sum of every number between(and including) them:

```javascript
sumAll(1, 4) // returns the sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 which is 10
```


## Hints

Think about how you would do this on pen and paper and then how you might translate that process into code:
- make sure you pay attention to the function parameters
- create a variable to hold the final sum
- loop through the given numbers ([link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration))
- on each iteration add the number to the sum
- return the sum after finishing the loop

# Notes
- In the said function, add 2 integers
- If null, not an integer or any number is below zero, return error
- Find the minimum between the two numbers
- Create a variable that will store the final value
- Loop through the two numbers as you add them to the variable created in step 3
